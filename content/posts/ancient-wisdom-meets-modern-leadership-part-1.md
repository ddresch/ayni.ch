# A 360 Degree View on the Self

## *Unlocking Leadership Potential Through Ayurveda & **Leadership Circle Profile**™ (LCP)*

In today’s dynamic world, effective leadership requires a deep understanding of both **inner consciousness and external impact**. The **Leadership Circle Profile**™offers a powerful framework to measure leadership effectiveness, while **Ayurveda**, the ancient science of life, provides profound insights into personal balance, purpose, and well-being. When combined, these two systems create a **transformational leadership model** that integrates modern science with timeless wisdom. 

### Ayurveda & Leadership: The Doshas as Leadership Archetypes

Just as Ayurveda identifies **Vata, Pitta, and Kapha** as the three fundamental energies governing nature and human physiology, these doshas also shape leadership styles:

* **Vata Leaders (Creative & Visionary)**: Innovative, adaptable, and forward-thinking but may struggle with consistency and grounding.
* **Pitta Leaders (Passionate & Driven)**: Goal-oriented, strategic, and courageous but can become overly intense or controlling.
* **Kapha Leaders (Stable & Nurturing)**: Empathetic, resilient, and community-focused but may resist change and lack urgency.

The **LCP Assessment** mirrors these tendencies by evaluating leaders on **Creative Competencies (vision, courage, collaboration, integrity)** and **Reactive Tendencies (control, compliance, self-protection).** By understanding their dominant dosha and leadership patterns, individuals can cultivate balance and **elevate their leadership effectiveness**.

### The Dharma-Based Leadership Model

Ayurveda aligns with leadership development through the four pillars of human fulfillment:

* **Dharma (Purpose & Duty):** Aligning leadership with a higher purpose and values.
* **Artha (Resources & Wealth):** Managing resources with wisdom to build sustainable success.
* **Kama (Passion & Fulfillment):** Inspiring teams with vision, creativity, and heart-centered leadership.
* **Moksha (Liberation & Growth):** Achieving self-mastery and transformational leadership.

The LCP framework helps leaders **uncover their subconscious patterns**, while Ayurveda ensures they operate in harmony with their unique nature and universal principles.

### The Five Foundational Influences on Leadership Growth

Leadership is not just about individual potential - it is shaped by the following underlying factors:

1. **Ātmā (Self-Awareness & Inner Wisdom):** Understanding the self through LCP’s 360-degree feedback and Ayurveda’s self-reflection practices.
2. **Deśa (Environment & Culture):** Aligning leadership strategies with organisational and societal needs.
3. **Kula (Community & Ancestry):** Recognizing inherited strengths and conditioning that shape leadership behaviors.
4. **Kāla (Timing & Cycles):** Leading with awareness of personal and collective cycles of change.
5. **Balā (Strength & Resilience):** Cultivating inner and outer strength through mindful practices and emotional intelligence.

### Why Integrate LCP & Ayurveda?

* Develop a leadership style that is **authentic, resilient, and adaptable**.
* **Enhance self-awareness** through a fusion of modern psychology and ancient wisdom.
* Identify and **overcome reactive tendencies** using Ayurvedic balance principles.
* Align personal and professional goals with **Dharma and conscious leadership**.
* Cultivate **holistic well-being**, leading to greater clarity, impact, and fulfillment.
